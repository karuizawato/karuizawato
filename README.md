- 🌱 I’m currently learning [p5](https://p5js.org/) a javascript library for creative code and exploring other technologies like [Python](https://www.python.org/), and VCS (GitHub and Git)... I like learning how to program a computer and practicing tasks with code. 🤔 I don't know if programmers are dying in the era of [AI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNeehd1RXhnVMBFi1WhWLx_Y), but I want to learn how to be a programmer from scratch. To me, it is awesome to know the building blocks of tech. I have to combine AI in my workflow, but sincerely I want to learn how to program a machine from its foundations.
