- 🌱 I’m currently learning p5 a javascript library for creative code and exploring other technologies like Python, and CVS (GitHub and Git)... I like learning how to program a computer and practicing tasks with code. 🤔 I don't know if programmers are dying in the era of AI, but I want to learn how to be a programmer from scratch. To me, it is awesome to know the building blocks of tech. I have to combine AI in my workflow, but sincerely I want to learn how to program a machine from its foundations.
